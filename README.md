This python project is meant to be a very simple mental health diary with various functions and widgets.

I put to the use tkinter, matplotlib and webcrawler.  

Tkinter is required to create an organized GUI that would be the shell of a program. 
Matplotlib is supposed to give a statistics of your mood. 
Webcrawler is going to take care of the media, since I will be taking the pictures straight from 
the internet.
